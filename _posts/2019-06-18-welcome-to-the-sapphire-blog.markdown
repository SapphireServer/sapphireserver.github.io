Welcome! Welcome to the Sapphire Blog. You have chosen, or been chosen, to experience one of the finest blogs on the internet. Jokes and references aside, given the interest in that we do something like this in the discord we now have a blog. I'll aim to quickly outline the kinds of content we'll be putting here, though naturally we wouldn't want to restrict ourselves to those topics specifically as there's likely to be other topics that come up down the line, but it should be _mostly_ Sapphire and FINAL FANTASY XIV related.

In a nutshell, the topics that will be covered are:

* Sapphire
  * Notable design and architecture changes/decisions
  * Feature implementation & details - likely accompanied with information from the client
  * Progress reports

* FFXIV Client
  * Data files and structures
  * Implementation details & weirdness
  * Reverse engineering & automation

Please look forward to itâ„¢
